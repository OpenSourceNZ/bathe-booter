= Bathe-Booter

This artefact is designed for use with the Bathe Plugin or something that mimics its behaviour.

It will allow you to start an application where all of the dependencies are offset inside the single zip file,
creating a series of classpaths such as:

[source]
----
 myfile.jar#!/WEB-INF/classes
 myfile.jar#!/WEB-INF/jars/spring-core-3.2.4.RELEASE/
----

_etc_

It looks in the +META-INF/MANIFEST.MF+ for the +Jump-Class+ (unless one is passed) and if it finds it, also looks
for the +Implementation-Version+ of that manifest and sets it as a system property, allowing you to build versioned
APIs and resources that reflect the application version (lmz-version uses this).

It also provides you with an interface +BatheInitializer+ that allows you to create services that will run and
initialize before your main application runs simply by including them on the classpath. All your parameters are passed.
